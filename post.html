                    <p>Linked list as the name suggests is a list of elements grouped linearly.<br></p>
                    <p>A unit element in a linked list consists of the following components:Data and Address of neighbour element. We refer to this unit element as a node. Therefore, a linked list is a set of nodes. The last node in the linked list points
                        to null, indicating that the linked list has ended.<br>Depending upon the number of nodes that are accessed directly, linked lists are further classified into:<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singly Linked List</span></strong>Here,
                        the primary node contains the address of the next node.&nbsp;Imagine playing a game of treasure hunt. You know the first clue, which contains information to direct you to the second clue and so forth.<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Doubly Linked List</span></strong><br>Here,
                        the primary node contains the address of the previous as well as the next node.Imagine travelling in a metro train. You know the first stop. The trains traverse back and forth according to its route.<br><br><br></p>

                        Easy to insert or delete an element.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. The size of the linked

                        Searching and sorting are costly because we cannot access elements randomly.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you
                            touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p><a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg"></a><span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
